## Create an euphonious word
All the letters of the English alphabet are divided into vowels and consonants.
The vowels are: a, e, i, o, u, y.
The remaining letters are consonants.

A word is considered euphonious if it doesn't have three or more vowels or consonants in a row. Otherwise, it is considered discordant.

Your task is to create euphonious words from the discordant ones. You can insert any letters inside the word.
For example, the word "schedule" is considered discordant because it has three consonants in a row: "sch". To create a euphonious word you need to add any vowel between 's' and 'c' or between 'c' and 'h'.
fixed string with 3 or more vowels or consoansts and return a string fixed

## Simple calculator
The program does the following operations:
            sum(+) -> 1 + 3 = 4
            subtract(-) -> 3 - 2 = 1
            mix operations -> -3 -- 1 +++ 3 -15 = -14
It handle very well with wxtra spaces, and aggregate operactions, like +++ and --
